    abstract = {{The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.}},

    ANNOTATE ={While not entirely relevant to my problem it rises a few important points about flock behavior. These include collision avoidance   	between members of the flock and the reduced perceptance of members whic hare moving in the midle of the flock. Collision avoidance between members will play a big role when trying to navigate the flock through a tight environment.}

    abstract = {{We consider the problem of self-deployment of a mobile sensor network. We are interested in a deployment strategy that maximizes the area coverage of the network with the constraint that each of the nodes has at least K neighbors, where K is a user-specified parameter. We propose an algorithm based on artificial potential fields which is distributed, scalable and does not require a prior map of the environment. Simulations establish that the resulting networks have the required degree with a high probability, are well connected and achieve good coverage. We present analytical results for the coverage achievable by uniform random and symmetrically tiled network configurations and use these to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.}},

@article{citeulike:8530320,
    abstract = {{The simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem asks
if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown
location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map
of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute
absolute vehicle location. Starting from estimation-theoretic
foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the
SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM
problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges
monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed.
It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle
location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle
uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an
autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown
environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a
perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded
estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial
implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an
outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map
observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key
issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a
practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with
absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In
conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the
solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building
algorithms and map management}},

The solution in this paper however was used on only a single car rather than a flock and using a millimeter wave radar for localising different obstacles and referance points. This makes this solution not applicable for my project, however it gave me some ideas concerning referance points.}
