set booleans for the direction the robot is moving in 1 = north 2 = east 3 = south 4 = west

Returns an int which represents the direction the robot is travelling in. The directions are specified which the start view of the simulator in mind meaning up = north, to the right = east, down = south and to the left = west. These directions are represented as follows\-:
