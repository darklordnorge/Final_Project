This are the recordings of the world file room1_empty.

It is worth noting that during the simulation runs displayed in
room1_empty_num2 and room1_empty_num4 the simulator crashed at the 
same around the same time. A screenshot of the simulator printout statement
has been included for both files.

Each simulation run was terminated after the map was finished or if the simulator
crashed.
