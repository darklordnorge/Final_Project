In this folder the project results are displayed. 
Every simulation was run 20 times durring the testing period, however in order to keep the overall
folder size down a couple of results per test environment are recorded and saved here. 
This has been deemed sufficinent to show the results archieved by the program, as every test environment
and its results has been discussed in the report. 

It is worth noting that all of these runs have been recorded on a Windows system, using the Webots PRO 7.4.3 client.
Test results archived in older versions of the simulator or UNIX based operating system may differ.
