To be able to map a environment with a autonomous robot which has no access to GPS or compass data is an interesting challenge. 
It is also an important challenge as GPS is not always available when mapping areas inside of buildings. \\
This paper describes the design and implementation of a program which maps environment on odometry calculations alone. 
The taken approach uses the Webots\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}  simulator and the E-Puck robot platform to map a simple environment. And shows the problems which can be encountered with odometry calculations and solutions to these problems. \\
The results gathered from this program are displayed and analysed and suggestions have been stated as to how to improve the program where necessary in future implementations.
